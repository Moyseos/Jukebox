//****This is what I have done:

* I've created a Jukebox that Displays at least one song, when the page loads.

* I've added a play button that turns into a pause button when you click on it.

* I've added a stop button, that stops the playing song.

* I've added an upload button that gives the user the ability to load songs into the Jukebox from his computer!

* In my page you will also see a shuffle element and a mute element, that still don't function.

//****This is what I am working on:

* I am now working on adding an input that gives the user the ability to upload songs through Soundcloud, and then add a display with the track information, like artist name, title with link to tracks page and description and genre.
